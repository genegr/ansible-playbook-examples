# VMware to OpenStack VM Migration

This repository contains Ansible playbooks designed to automate the migration of virtual machines (VMs) from a VMware vSphere platform to an OpenStack environment. The process leverages VMware vVols and the volume group handling capabilities provided by the Pure Storage Cinder driver.

---

## üß≠ Migration Workflow Overview

This utility is implemented as a single Ansible role composed of modular tasks executed sequentially as a complete workflow.

The workflow assumes:
- Source VMs are stored on a VMFS datastore.
- Each VM is moved (via **Storage vMotion**) to a temporary **vVols** datastore located on a **Pure Storage FlashArray**.
- Each virtual disk is then **adopted** into OpenStack Cinder using the **Pure Storage Cinder driver**, utilizing the **volume group support** introduced in **OpenStack 2025.1 (Epoxy)**.

The temporary vVols datastore **must reside in an unstretched FlashArray Pod**. This ensures the Pure Storage Cinder driver can clone the volumes internally‚Äîenabling easy rollback and iterative fine-tuning by working on a cold copy of the original disks.

## üß∞ Requirements

Ensure the following Ansible collections and their dependencies are installed:

- `community.vmware`
- `purestorage.flasharray`
- `openstack.cloud`

> üìö Please refer to the documentation for each collection for installation instructions and prerequisites.

## üöÄ Usage

1. All configuration variables are defined in:  
   `group_vars/all.yaml`

2. The inventory file (`inventory.ini`) includes a single target:  
   `localhost` (no changes needed)

3. To execute the playbook, run:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini migrate_vms.yaml

## Demo

There is a short video in the `demo` directory that shows an actual execution of the playbook that migrates threel Ubuntu VMs, all representing a moderately comples scenario: a microk8s that runs a postgresql example deployment.
